An ECMAScript engine is a program that executes source code written in a
version of the ECMAScript language standard, for example, JavaScript.

A Engine basically takes JS code, parser it, it's now in AST shape
go to an Interpreter (profiler and compiler) and transform it into bytecode
that our CPU on or computers, is going to understand to give it instructions.
